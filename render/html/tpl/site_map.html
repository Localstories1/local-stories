	<li><h3>This site (philosophy) : happenstance and serendipity applied to information</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>There is more truth in what we do not know in what we hope to know.
				<ul>
					<li>Information has properties that make its use unpredictable.</li>
					<li>Designing an IS is especially organizing adaptation , openness and the "good" risk are needed.</li>
					<li>New digital tools radically change the situation ( eg indexing instead of databases engines, BI webservices ... )</li>
					<li>These tools will be operating with a methodology adapted exit: ITIL , Lean , PMP ...</li>
					<li>A systemic vision : first I see the limits of what I know and associated experiences and I deduced where I need to be more curious or critical to understand the meaning of the overall system .</li>
					<li>I am more interested in what I do not know that I know . I did not certainty but I find opportunities and reconciliations galore.</li>
					<li>This is a fairly empirical and opposed to scientific approaches and forecasters who depart from the existing experience and finished and specific context to associate recognized that makes the most consensus solution approach.</li>
					<li>Traditional approaches successfully solve 85% of problems.</li>
					<li>With a different way of thinking , I'm more efficient, in anticipation, the strongs problems that resist the hardest and are the critical issues for the development of the company.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>A company is not producing but sharing experences high value for maximum direct and indirect stakeholders
				<ul>
					<li>The triptych "Cost quality time" is bullshit, the ROI is leading the relationship should last, projects must allow great experiences</li>
					<li>Skills are less important than people and their history and thier vision (about past and futur)</li>
					<li>Support activities (financial, accounting, purchasing, human resources, overhead, secretarial ...) disturb the reality of business. These are activities that generate sustained non-performing positions. But every employee should have the opportunity to directly participate in most important: the creation, production and sharing with the client.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Vision for RSE (Responsibility societal and environmental)
				<ul>
					<li>The role of the state: a minimum of elected producing minimal laws to ensure a reasonable safety so :
						<ul>
							<li>What state is on top of that is unlawful, abusive, often broken and too expensive to be acceptable</li>
							<li>Other powers (even sovereign) must return to responsible business</li>
							<li>We must reorganize power in the company it must be balanced between the bottom/top, environnement/bottom, environnement/top</li>
							<li>We must think that our achievement to bring humanity and planet</li>
							<li>We must build transparancy and running playful</li>
							<li>We must build a corporate altruism</li>
							<li>We need to try</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Vision for IT
				<ul>
					<li>With connected production resources IT fonction is to produce a collective board / game</li>
					<li>With connected production resources we don't need PC, Mobile, Tablet...</li>
					<li>With connected production resources we don't need document, mails, webservices, databases...</li>
					<li>With connected production resources we can't have its own IT infrastructure.</li>
					<li>With connected production resources we need to have a connected dashbord for all workflows.</li>
					<li>With connected production resources we need to have its own big index.</li>
					<li>With connected production resources we need to have its own workflow management systems.</li>

	<ul>
		<li>No external framework : learning what i can't do thinks myself and why</li>
		<li>Easy real time without optimization bullshit : 1 instance for PC, mobile, tablet... and no "pre"compilating, no caching</li>
		<li>No databases : when we "cast" an information we lots 80% of it's value</li>
